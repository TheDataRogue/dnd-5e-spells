## Datasets and analysis of Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition spells.
### On the datasets
These datasets were meant to be a resource for both players and data scientists alike. The goal was to make all the information about D&D spells readily available and easily accessible to all, **for free.** Basically, I was tired of having to look up spells in the physical books or third-party websites, while DND Beyond has an excellent filtering system that can find you exactly what spell or spells you're looking for, with the *small* caveat of having to pay hundreds of US dollars for the digital assets that include certain spells.

These datasets were all created by hand. I manually transcribed all the information about these spells. Naturally, as I am human, I may have made some mistakes. If you find any, please do let me know.

The one containing all the spells is 'D&D 5E Spells.xlsx'. The other datasets are all tables for specific spells, such as *Teleport* and *Control Weather*, for example.

There are other datasets to add to the /datasets folder. They are datasets with the stat blocks for creatures summoned or created by spells. I haven't settled on a standard format for all of them, since some creatures have very different attributes (some have damage immunities, condition immunities, or even bonus actions, where others do not). Since this work was primarily focused on spells, I did put too much effort into creatures. I am working on deciding the structure for a dataset of creatures, but until then, I will refrain from posting those datasets. When I do, all creature stat blocks will be in a single dataset.

### On the analysis
This is a work in progress. Right now, I will work towards making the general analysis of all the spells (that is, the full dataset). Eventually, when time allows it, I will analyze more specific items, such as: spells with material components, spells of a certain class, spells from a certain school of magic, etc. If you have any suggestions for things that I should look for during these, feel free to send them my way.

### On the other scripts
The /other_scripts folder is where I'll be posting things like functions, so I can easily import them into other files (especially to make my analysis more consistent).

### For the future
The end goal is not only to create a script that lets users look up spells with a filtering system as good as what DND Beyond has available, but also to make a script that lets users easily consult their known spells and select their prepared spells.
